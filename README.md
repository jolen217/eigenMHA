# TransTorch -- A Toy Pytorch Reimplementation for Transformer Deep Learning Models.
## Plans
* Use LightSeq with Flash-Attention to train and inference Transformer models.
  * with your own AutoGrad
  * with an application in time-series-prediction
  * using both CPU and GPU
  * with Roofline analysis
